Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "leightweight process) 
A process can spawn multiple threads.
+ All threads within a process share the same memory 
+ Leightweight 
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process 
+ Great for 1/0-bound tasks

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time 
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks 
- Not interruptable/killable 
- Careful with race conditions
