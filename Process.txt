 Process: An instance of a program (e.g a Python interpreter)

Advantages:
+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores 
+ Separate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes 
+ Great for CPU-bound processing 
+ New process is started independently from other processes 
+ Processes are interruptable/killable 
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIÄ» limitation

Disadvantages:
- Heavyweight 
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread. 
- More memory 
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
