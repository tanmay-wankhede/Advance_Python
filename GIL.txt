GIL: Global interpreter lock 
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python

- Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe

- Avoid:
- Use multiprocessing 
- Use a different, free-threaded Python implementation (Jython, IronPython) 
- use Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
